Project Title:
Analyzing Glass Data

Description of Business Problem:
Utilize Glass characteristics and oxide contents of elements from 214 samples to predict which type of glass they came from. 
This will help build a model that properly classifies glass types based on remaining elements left over at the scene of a crime. 
This can be utilized to improve crime scene investigations by speeding up the process of determining what type of glass was originally at the scene. It will help acquire evidence and its use.
